This is a jupyter notebook.
It aims to detect fraudulent transaction in the given credit card dataset.
The size of the dataset is too large for it to be uploaded on github.
So here's the link to it: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kartik2112/fraud-detection
Plus, i have only considered the first 100,000 rows for consideration as the execution time was very large for the actual file.
The execution time is given in the code.
Thank You!
